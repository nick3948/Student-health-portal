🩺 OSU Student Health Portal — Redesign

Course: CS 565 – Human-Computer Interaction
Project Goal: To redesign the OSU student health portal for a smoother, more intuitive and stress-free experience.

Target Audience:
Our design is focused on OSU students, especially those who are new, under stress or unsure about using online health systems.

User Scenario: Abi’s Story -
Meet Abi, a new OSU student feeling unwell with a sore throat and cough. She tries to schedule a medical appointment through the portal, but the experience is long, confusing and lacks clear guidance.

Abi’s struggle inspired our redesign. We built a system that supports students like her with clear steps, helpful cues and less frustration.


Key Outcomes of Our Redesign:
	1. Cut screen count by 50%: The old portal had 12 steps: we reduced it to just 6 (including pop-ups), making the flow faster and easier.
	2. Resolved 8+ usability bugs identified through evaluations and persona testing.
	3. Applied core UI/UX principles: Focused on clarity, feedback, simplicity, and user control.
